## OpenSearch Build Libraries
OpenSearch build libraries consist of shared libraries used to build, test and release OpenSearch, OpenSearch Dashboards and its associated products such as clients, drivers, etc.

### Jenkins Shared Libraries
This repository consist of jenkins shared libraries as one of the libraries. Read more about jenkins shared libraries [here](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/)
Checkout different [retrieval methods](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#retrieval-method) that can be used by jenkins files to use this remote library.

Example:
```
lib = library(identifier: 'jenkins@<tag>', retriever: modernSCM([
    $class: 'GitSCMSource',
    remote: 'https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build-libraries.git',
]))
```
