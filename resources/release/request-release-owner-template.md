Hi $LIST_OF_MAINTAINERS, </br>

Could someone kindly volunteer to take on the role of release owner for this component in order to meet the [entrance criteria](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/RELEASING.md#entrance-criteria-to-start-release-window) ? </br>
If no one is able to take it on, we may need to assign someone randomly before the release window opens. </br>

Thank you in advance for your help!
