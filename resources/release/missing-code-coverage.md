Hi, </br>

$COMPONENT_NAME is not reporting code-coverage for branch [$BRANCH]($CODECOV_URL). </br>
Please fix the issue by checking your CI workflow responsible for reporting code coverage. See the details on [code coverage reporting](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-plugins/blob/main/TESTING.md#code-coverage-reporting) </br>

Thank you!
